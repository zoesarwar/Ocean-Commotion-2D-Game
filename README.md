## Operating Notes For Built Game:
* The splash screen will appear while the game is loading.
* The fish is the main player and you use the up and down arrows on your keyboard to move.
* You want to avoid the sharks you get three lives (as displayed in the top left of my game), hitting a shark will cost you a life. When all 3 lives run out, it’s game over.
* Coins get you 1 point because they’re easier to collect. The starfish, which is harder to get is worth 5 points. Note the inventory system in the top right while playing the game.
* The objective of the game is to see how many points you can obtain before losing all 3 lives.
* The farther your fish gets along in the game, the harder the game gets. The time between generated sharks starts at 1.5 seconds, which makes the game rather easy. As you progress in the game, the sharks speed up at a rate of 0.05 seconds, thus increasing difficulty as you go. The same thing goes with the coins. The starfish stays at a constant rate, because it is worth so many points it becomes harder to collect. 
* When you lose all three lives, the game will freeze and display “Game Over” as well as your score. You can then choose to play again or go back to the main menu.
* The play again button can be hit during any time of the game, it will start you with fresh lives and points. 
* The Main Menu will appear following the splash screen. “Play Game” will take you to my game itself, “Rules” displays the rules for playing, “Credits” takes you to my organized credits page and “Exit Game” closes out the application entirely.
* My Game, Rules and Credits pages all have “Main Menu” buttons that will bring you back to the main menu, where you can choose to continue playing, re-read instructions, re-read credits or exit the application entirely.

## Lessons learned
* I am not the most artistic person, so I learned how to be creatively artistic when it came to creating my original images!
* I learned a lot about how to make it so that your code responds to the keys on your keyboard appropriately. (i.e. how to make your character respond to the up and down keys as well as how to make it so it responds to you holding down a key).
* I learned what a splash screen was and how to implement one.
* I learned how to incorporate sound into my game and make sure it was looped correctly. I also learned how to make sound correspond with each scene. 
* I learned how to make gameplay difficulty change appropriately.

## Original Images:
* I created a number of original images with a free iOS app called PicsArt. 
* My original art is what follows: the fish, the coin, the starfish, the splash screen/credits page background image and the purple octopus on the main menu.
